These can get in the way of some optimizations, such as memory address calculations. It is particulary import for gather and scatters, as these functions take a Vec{W,Ptr{T}} argument to load/store a Vec{W,T} to/from. If sizeof(T) < sizeof(Int), converting the <W x $(typ)* vectors of pointers in LLVM to integer vectors as they're represented in Julia will likely make them too large to fit in a single register, splitting the operation into multiple operations, forcing a corresponding split of the Vec{W,T} vector as well. This would all be avoided by not promoting/widenting the <W x $(typ)> into a vector of Ints.\n\nFor this last issue, an alternate workaround would be to wrap a Vec of 32-bit integers with a type that defines it as a pointer for use with internal llvmcall functions, but I haven't really explored this optimization.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"#VectorizationBase.pause-Tuple{}","page":"Home","title":"VectorizationBase.pause","text":"pause()\n\nFor use in spin-and-wait loops, like spinlocks.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"#VectorizationBase.promote_div-Tuple{Union{Integer, Union{VectorizationBase.AbstractSIMDVector{var\"#s2\", var\"#s1\"}, VectorizationBase.VecUnroll{var\"#s3\", var\"#s2\", var\"#s1\", V} where {var\"#s3\", V<:VectorizationBase.AbstractSIMDVector{var\"#s2\", var\"#s1\"}}} where {var\"#s2\", var\"#s1\"<:Integer}}, Union{Integer, Union{VectorizationBase.AbstractSIMDVector{var\"#s138\", var\"#s139\"}, VectorizationBase.VecUnroll{var\"#s3\", var\"#s138\", var\"#s139\", V} where {var\"#s3\", V<:VectorizationBase.AbstractSIMDVector{var\"#s138\", var\"#s139\"}}} where {var\"#s138\", var\"#s139\"<:Integer}}}","page":"Home","title":"VectorizationBase.promote_div","text":"Promote, favoring <:Signed or <:Unsigned of first arg.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"#VectorizationBase.unrolled_indicies-NTuple{6, Int64}","page":"Home","title":"VectorizationBase.unrolled_indicies","text":"Returns a vector of expressions for a set of unrolled indices.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"}]
